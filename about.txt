Hello, my name is David and I am an Undergraduate Computer Science student at the University of Michigan College of Engineering in Ann Arbor, MI. I am always writing software or tinkering with hardware. My primary interests are Linux and embedded systems. I am passionate about open source and my everyday laptop runs Arch Linux. I enjoy solving problems and look forward to taking on new challenges.
