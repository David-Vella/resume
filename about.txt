I am an undergraduate Computer Science student at the University of Michigan College of Engineering in Ann Arbor, MI. My skills include C/C++ and Python programming as well as Linux and shell scripting. My interests include embedded systems and using software to interact with the physical world. In my free time, I design Arduino and Raspberry Pi based embedded systems. Check out what I am currently working on at my website: https://www.davidvella.me. I enjoy solving problems and look forward to taking on new challenges.
